    <h2>
        Ingredients:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>32 oz cream cheese² softened to room temperature (910g)</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar (200g)</li>
        <li>⅔ cups sour cream (160g)</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs room</li>
        <li>500 ml coffee or more</li>
        <li>one pack of ladyfingers</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).</li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be jiggly.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
        <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
